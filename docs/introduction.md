# Introduction

Welcome to *The Corn Programming Language*, an introductory book about Cornlang. The Corn programming language helps you write more maintainable code in a short time, with more reliability.

## Who Cornlang is for

Cornlang is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let's look at a few of those groups:

### Teams of Developers

Cornlang is a language designed to be as easy to use as possible without compromising robustness. As a result, it is significantly easier to learn than other programming languages. Low-level code is prone to bugs caused by memory safety violations. In Cornlang, the compiler warns the user about these kinds of issues ahead-of-time in order for developers to identify and possibly fix these issues before release.

### Students

Cornlang is for students and those who are interested in learning about programming. The ease of use and the error-safe syntax makes it an awesome beginner programming language.

### Companies

Cornlang is ideal for companies looking to build more reliable, maintainable, and scalable software. The flexibility of Cornlang allows it to be used in a wide variety of applications, including command-line tools, web applications, games, embedded devices, audio and video transcoding and encoding, and much more.

### Open Source Developers

Cornlang is for people who want to build software that is open source. The Corn programming language is a language that is designed to be easy to read and understand and is easy to contribute to.

### People Who Value Stability

Cornlang is ideal for people who value stability and reliability. Corncomb (the interpreter for Cornlang) and Cornpiler (the compiler for Cornlang) are designed to help you write more maintainable code in Cornlang.

The Corn language hopes to support many other users as well, and we would love to hear from you if you are using Cornlang in your projects. The users mentioned here are just a few of the many people who use Cornlang. Give Cornlang a try and see if it works for you.

## Who This Book is For

This book assumes you are familiar with programming and have some experience with programming languages, but doesn't make any assumptions about which one. We've tried to make the learning material for Cornlang broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We don't spend a lot of time about what programming *is* or how to think about common problems. If you are entirely new to programming hovewer, we recommend you start with a book that introduces you to programming.

## How to Use This Book

In general, this book assumes that you're reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters will assume you've read the previous chapters.
